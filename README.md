# Compact Reddit Redirect

Dislike Reddit's mobile site? Compact Reddit Redirect will ensure that you always load the compact (i.reddit.com) design instead.

Will force all reddit.com usage to i.reddit.com. Will work when navigating to the site, opening links, etc. Works regardless of whether you are logged in or not, and in incognito mode.

Extension for Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/compact-reddit-redirect/
